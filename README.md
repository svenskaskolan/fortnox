# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

intalled less using npm intall less

intall build server

npm install -g serve
run build version using serve -s build

css changes should be made to the .less files located in the css/less folder beneath the src folder.  Convert .less files to .css using the following command issued from the src directory.

lessc css/less/mystyle.less css/mystyle.css

This will convert the .less file to a .css file in the parent folder.  A script/webpack can be used to do this automatically when changes are made to a .less file.

In the color picker (I'm using Chrome color picker via react-color) if the selected colour is too dark, I change the text color to white so it can still be read.

I have managed to prevent any shade of blue from being picked, it does make the color picker appear to work in a strange way, but I think its still correct.

I added react router to the bundle for some basic routing.

I have used Jest for testing.  More detailed tests should be added.

Styling is quite basic, since starting from scratch without a styleguide.
